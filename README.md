# Task Finisher Frontend

A front-end part of Task Finisher, a complete CRUD TODO app featuring minimal,
clean, easy-to-use interface.

The purpose of this app is primarily for personal uses (may available for few
users testing) to streamline my task managing and note taking. This project is a
part of my JavaScript/TypeScript learning journey for both front-end and
back-end development in JSD9 bootcamp program.
